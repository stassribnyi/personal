              Nice to see you here. I am a skilled front-end engineer with more
              than 4 years of working experience both with front-end and
              back-end. I develop single-page web applications using a variety
              of frameworks such as React and Angular. I will be glad to
              collaborate with you.
            </p>

            Hello again, I am Stas and I am front-end engineer üòä. Working with
            UI is my passion and so I do it using the latest technologies such
            as React and Angular (but personally prefer using React and Vanilla
            Javascript üòÅ). Some time ago I used to be a full-stack engineer, so
            I worked both with back and front end code. Now I use all my
            knowledge in UI development world. I started my wonderful career
            about five years ago by studying AltexSoft company full-stack
            courses, I did my best to learn the most about software development
            and apply for a job at this company. Since then I worked with
            several companies, with the different teams, hold different
            positions and I am here, to provide you with all that experience to
            make you happy üòé.

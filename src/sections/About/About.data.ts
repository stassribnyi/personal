    description: `I am passionate about working with UI and I use the latest technologies 
    such as React and Angular (although I personally prefer using React and Vanilla Javascript). 
    I have experience working as a full-stack engineer in the past, so I am familiar with all key parts required to build excellent application. 
    Currently, I am focused on UI development and applying all my knowledge in this field. 
    I started my career more than five years ago by studying at university and simultaneously visiting full-stack software engineering courses. 
    Since then, I have worked with several companies,  held different positions, participated
    in vast variety of projects, and more importantly gained valuable experience that I would love to share with you.`,

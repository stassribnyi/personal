            fast-minded person. I mean, he can find several
            solutions for resolving a task, and if no one works,
            Stas will find a couple more. I saw how Stas worked as a
            front- and as a back-developer, and it was cool. Stas
            has his own opinion, and arguments his position, but he
            hears the opponents and can change his mind, so, Stas is
            a good team-player. Stas organized the work process in
            his team as well, when it was needed.`,

            clear for you. In his work he is guided by design
            patterns and always pays much care and attention to the

        description: `Way back when being a part of a team hiring junior .NET
            software engineers from the company's training courses,
            Stanislav impressed me by not only his programming
            skills but also his openness and thirst for knowledge.
            Since then we worked with Stanislav on several projects
            and he proved himself as both a responsible skilful
            Software Engineer and a great Team Player. As a
            full-stack .NET software engineer, he was able to
            resolve both front- and back-end tasks at a high level.
            Stanislavâ€™s dedication to the projects, ability to learn
            quickly, and openness for new challenges is worth
            mentioning, too. It was only a pleasure to have such an
            Asset in the project team!`,

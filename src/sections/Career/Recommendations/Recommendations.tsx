                            Stas is a very fast-learning developer, and he is a
                            fast-minded person. I mean, he can find several
                            solutions for resolving a task, and if no one works,
                            Stas will find a couple more. I saw how Stas worked as a
                            front- and as a back-developer, and it was cool. Stas
                            has his own opinion, and arguments his position, but he
                            hears the opponents and can change his mind, so, Stas is
                            a good team-player. Stas organized the work process in
                            his team as well, when it was needed.

                            Way back when being a part of a team hiring junior .NET
                            software engineers from the company's training courses,
                            Stanislav impressed me by not only his programming
                            skills but also his openness and thirst for knowledge.
                            Since then we worked with Stanislav on several projects
                            and he proved himself as both a responsible skilful
                            Software Engineer and a great Team Player. As a
                            full-stack .NET software engineer, he was able to
                            resolve both front- and back-end tasks at a high level.
                            Stanislavâ€™s dedication to the projects, ability to learn
                            quickly, and openness for new challenges is worth
                            mentioning, too. It was only a pleasure to have such an
                            Asset in the project team!
